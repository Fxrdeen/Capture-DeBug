First, we take input of the array and it's size.
Then, we will sort the array and then initialize a variable to 1.
Then, iterate the array. If the value of the element at the array index matches res, increment it. Else, break and return the element, since that element is the missing element.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
