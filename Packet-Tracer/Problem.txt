Problem Id: PACKET_TRACER

Problem Statement: 
Consider a scenario where 'N' packets have been received by the receiver's network layer. These packets need to be reordered before being sent to the upper layers. The correct order corresponds to a specific sequence derived from the packet indices.

To determine the correct order, you can use a binary search tree. Each packet index will be inserted into the BST in the order they are received. Then, use the decryption algorithm to print the messages. 
 
Decryption algo: 
First visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally print the data of the current node. 

Input Format: 
The first line consists of an integer 'N' which indicates the number of nodes. 
The second line consists of 'N' spaced integers.  

Output Format: 
Print the decrypted form of the message without spaces. 

Constraints :   
0 <= N <= 10^2 
-100 <= node->val <= 100
