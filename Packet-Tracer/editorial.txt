The decryption algorithm is nothing but the post order traversal of the constructed binary search tree. 

Visit the left subtree by recursively traversing all the nodes in the left subtree.
Visit the right subtree by recursively traversing all the nodes in the right subtree.
Finally, visit the current node itself.
So, in postorder traversal, you first explore the entire left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visit the current node.

This traversal order is often used to process the nodes in a tree in a specific sequence, such as performing certain operations or obtaining a desired output.

Time Complexity: It is O(n)  where n is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity: It is O(n) where n is the number of nodes.
