Title: The Try-hard

Description: 

Yuvraj was a coding try-hard. He codes he best when he eats his favorite food. And his favorite food is the one with the most cheese in it. 

You are given a list of 'n' foods with the amount of cheese in it. The ith food has a[i] amount of cheese in it.

You can do 2 operations any number of times(possibly zero) on the foods.

1. Choose an index i such that, 1 <= i < n, and swap a[i] and a[i+1].

2. Choose the last element, a[n] and make all elements equal to this element, more formally, assign, a[1] = a[n], a[2] = a[n], ... , a[n-1] = a[n].

Output the minimum number of operations required to make all foods have the maximum amount of cheese. That is, make all elements of the array equal to the maximum.

Example: 

n = 5
a = [1,2,3,5,4]

By applying operation 1 on the index 4, we get a = [1,2,3,4,5].
Now by applying the operation 2 on the array, we have, a = [5,5,5,5,5].

Standard Input:

The first line contains a positive integer n, the number of foods.
The second line contains, n space-separated integers, where a[i] is the ith integer.

Standard Output:

Print one integer, the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal to the maximum element.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= a[i] <= 10^9

Input:

5
1 2 3 5 4


Output:

2
